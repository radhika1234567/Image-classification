# Dog Breed Classification - Computer Vision
# About this project
This project was implemented for final project submission for Buan 6V99 - Special Topics in Business Analytics - Deep Learning
This was one of two submissions for an inclass Kaggle competition and finished in 4th place.Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/final-project-dl-spring-2020/leaderboard

I got 4th rank. In this competition, I was given a dataset of dog images. The training dataset has sub-folders, the name of the subfolder is the label (breed category) 
of the image. For example, all the images in subfolder 9 belong to breed category 9. You have to predict the category of the dog images in the test dataset.
