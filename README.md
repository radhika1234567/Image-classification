# Image-classification
This will be a Kaggle Competition. I used the following URL to participate in the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/t/633a758c71334025835ce953d57e8335

In this competition, I was given a dataset of dog images. The training dataset has sub-folders, the name of the subfolder is the label (breed category) 
of the image. For example, all the images in subfolder 9 belong to breed category 9. You have to predict the category of the dog images in the test dataset.
