# Dog Breed Classification - Computer Vision
# About this project
This project was implemented for final project submission for Buan 6V99 - Special Topics in Business Analytics - Deep Learning
This was one of two submissions for an inclass Kaggle competition and finished in 4th place.Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/final-project-dl-spring-2020/leaderboard

# Objective:
The object of this project is to accurately predict the type of dog breed from any given image.
This type of classification is a common problem in computer vision and has user applications in tools like Google Lens.
Dog Breed classification is an enhanced classification problem than regular object detection since prediction granularity has increased from dogs vs objects to different types of dogs.

# Data : ImageWoof
Imagewoof is a subset of 10 classes of dogs from Imagenet. These images are not that easy to classify, since they're all dog breeds. The breeds are: Australian terrier, Border terrier, Samoyed, Beagle, Shih-Tzu, English foxhound, Rhodesian ridgeback, Dingo, Golden retriever, Old English sheepdog.
The Data set has been taken from: https://github.com/fastai/imagenette
